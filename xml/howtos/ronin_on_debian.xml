        <p>
          Ronin's dependencies (such as do_sqlite3 and nokogiri) require
          certain libraries and their header files to be installed:
        </p>

        <shell>$ sudo apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev</shell>
      </section>

      <section label="ruby" title="Ruby">
        <p>
          If you already haven't done so, we must fully install Ruby on the
          system.
        </p>

        <shell>$ sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev rdoc irb libyaml-ruby libjson-ruby libopenssl-ruby</shell>
      </section>

      <section label="rubygems" title="RubyGems">
        <p>
          Since Debian's package for RubyGems is woofly out of date, we
          shall install the most recent RubyGems from source.
        </p>

        <note>
          <p>
            This section can be skiped all together if you are using
            Ruby 1.9.1 or above.
          </p>
        </note>

        <shell>$ wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/45905/rubygems-1.3.1.tgz
$ tar -xzvf rubygems-1.3.1.tgz
$ cd rubygems-1.3.1
$ sudo ruby setup.rb</shell>

        <note>
          <p>
            If you are using Debian's version of RubyGems, you must
            add /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/ to your PATH variable.
          </p>

          <shell>echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc</shell>
        </note>

        <p>
          For Ruby 1.8.x and earlier you'll have to edit your
          <kbd>.bashrc</kbd> or <kbd>.profile</kbd> file in order to have
          Ruby automatically load rubygems.
        </p>

        <shell>$ echo 'export RUBYOPT="-r rubygems"' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc</shell>

      <section label="ronin" title="Ronin">
        <p>
          Now that your Debian system has been properly setup with Ruby,
          we can finally install Ronin:
        </p>

        <shell>$ sudo gem install ronin</shell>
      </section>

      <section label="developers" title="Developers">
        <p>
          If you plan on testing or contributing code to Ronin, you will
          need to install a couple extra RubyGems.
        </p>
        <shell>$ sudo gem install hoe rspec</shell>
