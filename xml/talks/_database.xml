    <title>The Database</title>

    <p>
      <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a> + 
      <a href="http://sqlite.org/">sqlite3</a>:

    <notes>
      <p>
        The Database uses DataMapper, a Ruby ORM, and the sqlite3 database
        by default.

    <title>ORM</title>

    <p>Object Relational Mapper:</p>
    <code>require 'ronin/model'

class Person

  include Ronin::Model

  property :id, Serial
  property :name, String
  property :age, Integer

end</code>

    <notes>
      <p>
        ORM stands for Object Relational Mapper, meaning that we can define
        our models as Classes, and rows in the database become Objects.

    <title>No SQL Needed</title>

    <code>Person.create(:name => 'bla', :age => 22)</code>
    <code>Person.first(:name => 'bla')</code>
    <code>Person.all(:age.in => (18..30))</code>

    <notes>
      <p>
        A major benefit of using an ORM, is that there is no SQL needed.
        Create and query records all from the comfort of Ruby.
