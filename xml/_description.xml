      All source code within Ronin is licensed under the GPL-2,
      therefore no user will ever have to pay for Ronin or updates to
      Ronin. Not only is the source code free, the Ronin project will
      not sell enterprise grade security snake-oil solutions, give
      private training classes or later turn Ronin into commercial
      software.

      Ronin was not designed as one monolithic framework but instead as
      a collection of libraries which can be individually installed.
      This allows users to pick and choose what functionality they
      want in Ronin.

    <p>
      Ronin does not have a central repository of exploits and
      payloads which all developers contribute to. Instead Ronin has
      Overlays, repositories of code that can be hosted on any
      SVN/Hg/Git/Rsync server. Users can then use Ronin to quickly
      install or update Overlays. This allows developers and users to
      form their own communities, independent of the main developers
      of Ronin.
