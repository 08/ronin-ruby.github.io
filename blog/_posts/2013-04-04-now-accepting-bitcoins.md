Ronin is now accepting [Bitcoin] donations!

[12tWhiWQaNxc5q37BVt6HZv5iihbRUHayC](bitcoin:12tWhiWQaNxc5q37BVt6HZv5iihbRUHayC?label=ronin)

We decided to start accepting donations as a way for users to help support the
development of Ronin. Once enough Bitcoins have been donated, we can set
Bounties for new features, tip contributors or even buy a domain name
from [NameCheap].

Bitcoin is a virtual p2p crypto-currency, that is not regulated or taxed.
This makes transferring Bitcoins far easier and safer than transferring funds
via PayPal. An increasing amount of online and offline merchants now accept
Bitcoins as a form of payment. Bitcoins can be bought and sold on many of the
online [exchanges].
