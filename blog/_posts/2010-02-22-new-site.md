As listed in the [Spring Cleaning Campaign (2010)](/blog/2010/01/12/spring-cleaning.html),
a new website has been designed for [Ronin](/). The new site is
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) based and hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-ruby.github.com).

Much of the website is written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which makes
writting new content a breeze. As always, we accept edits to the site,
simply [fork](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-ruby.github.com/fork)
the site, commit your changes and send one of the Ronin developers
a pull-request.

You'll probably notice that we also added a few new sections to the site.
The [front page](/) now shows three random examples pulled from the
[Examples](/examples/) section, illustrating some of the things Ronin
can do in a few lines. One can even subscribe to an
[Atom feed](/examples/atom.xml) of the Examples, to get the latest tricks.

The [Downloads](/downloads/) link in the menu now points to an actual
downloads page, containing links to `.tar.gz`, `.zip` and `.gem` files
of Ronin.

Lastly, Ronin now has a [Developer Blog](/blog/) with
[DISQUS](http://disqus.com/) powered comments.
