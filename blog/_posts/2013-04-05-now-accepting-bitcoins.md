Ronin is now accepting [Bitcoin] donations!

[12tWhiWQaNxc5q37BVt6HZv5iihbRUHayC](bitcoin:12tWhiWQaNxc5q37BVt6HZv5iihbRUHayC?label=ronin)

We decided to start accepting donations as a way for users to help support the
development of Ronin. Once enough Bitcoins have been donated, we can set
Bounties for new features, tip contributors or even buy a domain name
from [NameCheap].

Bitcoin is a virtual p2p crypto-currency, that is not regulated or taxed.
This makes transferring Bitcoins far easier and safer than transferring funds
via PayPal. An increasing amount of [online][1] and [offline][2] merchants are
starting to accept Bitcoins. Bitcoins can be bought and sold on many of the
online [exchanges] with native currency.
